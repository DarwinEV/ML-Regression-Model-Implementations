# Machine Learning Model Implementations
## Statistical Linear Regression
- Linear regression from a statistical point of view. This implementation is only uses 1 parameter to predict the output and finds the line that minimizes the covariance.
## Numpy Linear Regression
- Linear Regression performed on the MNIST dataset. 45 classifiers are made and each gets > 90% accuracy on each classifier.
## 2-D Perceptron
- Perceptron model that converges to the line of bet fit given a linearly seperable dataset.
## Decision Tree Algorithm
- Uses the weights obtained from the linear regression implementation to create a decision tree. This is able to capture data that is distributed in non-linear fashion.
